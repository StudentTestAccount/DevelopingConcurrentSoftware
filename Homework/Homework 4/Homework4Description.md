Homework 4
==========
Write unit tests to verify the behavior of the thread-safe cache we discussed in class.

Due: Prior to class on February 17

Starting with the initial source code in Homework4.sln:

1. Provide unit tests to verify all of the behavior of the cache class.
2. Provide unit tests to verify all of the behavior of the locking_cache_strategy_helper class.

You will be graded on:

1. The organization and content of the unit test code.

This assignment is intended to be collaborative. You may work on it with one or two other students in the course, and provide one implementation for the group. You are also encouraged to submit your finished work prior to the due date and receive feedback from me.

You should submit your finished work as a pull request on Github.
